### Input Data

A file that contains data for the month before withdrawal and
the fact of withdrawal for a certain month (gym_churn.csv file)

### Conclusion

Based on data and the analysis I found the
characteristics that have the greatest impact on outflow.
For the convenience of analysis, I devided clients into five clusters 
in order to identify pairs of the "high-quality-reliable" type with the same 
categorical characteristics. I gave forecast and reccomendations on the clients retention.
